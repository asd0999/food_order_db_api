# Food Central Application 
Our application allows logged-in users to order food from select restaurants. The user first arrives at the home page of our site, where they should first login to their account. After clicking on their account, the user will be redirected back the home page where thy can see a list of restaurants to order from. Additionally, the user can click on the "My Account" at the top to see their account details and past order history. The account details consist of the Username, phone number, and email, while the "Past Orders" section displays the the restaurant, date, time, and food items of each order. 

On the home page, each restaurant name is displayed along with the restaurant's rating, delivery fee, approximate delivery time. After clicking into a restaurant, the user will find the restaurant's menu, address, phone number. By clicking on a specific menu item, that food item will be added to the user's cart on the right-side of the page. Items can be deleted from the cart by clicking on the "X". After the user is satisfied with their cart details, they can click the "Place Order!" button, and their order details will be saved. The user can also look at the Past Orders in "My Account" to see that this order was saved.
